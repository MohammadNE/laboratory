# Keys

## what is the Key column when you run show table columns command?

you can have multiple rows with exactly the same data  but if you want all your data being uniquely identified you should add unique ID for each row to be identifier

## KEY TYPES

- <https://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/sqlserver/different-types-of-sql-keys>

## Create table with primary key

```sql
CREATE TABLE <table_name>(pk INT NOT NULL , <column_1_name> <data_type>, <column_2_name> <data_type>, PRIMARY KEY (pk));
```

- the above command will mark the pk column as PRI key in table.

- the pk field can't be duplicated.

- in a real application it would be a pain to give IDs by ourselves, so you can auto increment it.

## Create table with auto incremented primary key

``` sql
CREATE TABLE <table_name>(pk INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, <column_1_name> <data_type>,<column_2_name> <data_type>, PRIMARY KEY (pk));
```

- the above command will add auto_increment into Extra of the table.
