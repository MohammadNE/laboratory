# Refining Selections

more weapons in the Arsenal

## WHERE

it will filter the result, the condition or filtering happen above the column

``` sql
SELECT * FROM <table_name> WHERE condition;
```

- the filtering is not case-sensitive, the lower or upper case doesn't matter

## DISTICT

it will gives you all disticted and unique combination columns

``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;
```

- focus, it will drop duplicate combinations.

## ORDER BY

``` sql
SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name> ORDER BY <property_1>, <property_2>;
```

- it's ascending by default

- if <property_1> was same for 2 objects, then it will compare <property_2>

- you can append ASC OR DESC keywords to it.

- you can also order from selected columns:

``` sql
SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name> ORDER BY column_index;
```

## LIMIT

allows us to specify a limit_number for how many result we want

``` sql
- SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name> LIMIT starting_index, limit_number;
```

- starting_index started from 0 by default

``` sql
SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name> LIMIT limit_number;
```

## LIKE

allows us for better searching (checks for similarity)

``` sql
WHERE  <column_name> LIKE '<string>';
```

- wildcards: `%` symbol means any character(s) placeholder (useful in pattern matching)

- wildcards: `_` symbol to specify excatly one character placeholder (useful in pattern matching)

- the filtering is not case-sensitive, the lower or upper case doesn't matter

- you can use REGEXP here

- focus: if you search for character `%` or `_` in string, use scape character `\` like: `\%` or `\_`
