## intro
- swarm-mode: is a server clustring solution built inside Docker
it brings different operating-systems or hosts or nodes 
into a single managable unit that you can then orchestrate
the life-cycle of containers in it.

## why
- how we maintain hundrands of containers accros many servers ?

- how do we automate container lifecycle (start-stop-restart-recreate-delete) ?

- how to scale out/in/up/down ?

- handle if containers fail ?

- how to update and replace them without downtime (blue-green deploy) ?

- control and track containers ?

- how we can talk to servers inside containers (cross-node virtual-networks) ?

- how to ensure our containers are only run our prefered servers ?

- how store secrets and get them to the right container ?

## basic concepts

- manager-nodes have a local-database on them (known as raft database)

- raft database is shared among all manager nodes

- manager-nodes stores configuration and information it needs to be authority 
inside swarm their responsibility is to manage the swarm securily.

- we can demote or promote workers and managers to each other

- worker-nodes are nodes or VMs or hosts where actual works will be done, 
means on each worker we have a docker engine and related containers.

- so think of manager-nodes as nodes that have permission to control
worker-nodes

- you can't do scaling with `docker run` command and we use
`service` commands to deal with that (replacement for `run` command in manager-nodes)

- with `docker service` we can scale our application and for example you
can specify how many replicas you want and each replica is known as `task`
so a single service can have multiple tasks and on each task we launch the
same container

- `docker-service` will ask swarm where to put replicas, they maybe on different nodes

### summerize
in real world suppose you have different services (applications), like
auth-api and an item-api and you want to publih your apllications
you configure 2 docker-compose for auth and item api to run them
independently of each other, in auth-api you may want to use a
redis and cassandra image and bundle them with your codes to run.
you repeat this procedure also for item-api and then you use swarm
to manage auth-nodes and item-nodes on cloud.

## impotant-commands

1. `docker swarm`

- it manages the swarm like: initializing, joining and leaving swarm

- `docker swarm init` will do security automation like signing certificate and
will create raft-database to store configs and secrets and then your current
machine will be a manager node and then you can add workers to this swarm.
what it does:
> root certificate for swarm which is used for all managers and workers
>
> manager-certificate for current manager-node
>
> create join-tokens 
>
> ceate raft-database fo root-rcertificate, configs and secrets (encrypted)

- `docker swarm join-token manager`

2. `docker node`

- `docker node ls` : list swarm nodes

- in workers we don't have permission to run above command

- from manager node you can change worker to a manager via
`docker node update --role manager node2`

3. `docker service`

- service will do automation on the backend, it will manage runtimes,
handle up/down, 

- add more functionality to `docker run` like scaling

- `docker service --help` will make a change in blue-green pattern

- docker service create alpine ping 8.8.8.8

- docker service ls : will list services

- docker service ps <service-id> : will list tasks (containers) in a service

- docker service update <service-id> --replicas 3 : will update 
a service config in blue-green pattern

- `docker service update`: will list runtime config changing

4. `docker stack`

5. `docker secret`

6. `docker update`

it's related to `docker run` and you can see the differnce with `docker service update`

## docker machine

- docker-machine create node1

- docker-machine ssh node1

- docker-machine env node1

### notes
- you can create your nodes on digital-ocean and then
ssh into them via `ssh root@<IP>`
