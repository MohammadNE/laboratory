- create 3 manager nodes on 3 hosts,
- from leader type the below:

- docker node ls
- docker service create --replicas 4 alpine ping 8.8.8.8
- docker service ls : list services
- docker node ps : list containers on current node (node1 by default)
- docker node ps node2 : list containers on node2
- docker service ps <service-id>

### notes (SOO BEAUTIFUL)
these 4 replicas in service will be distributed among all nodes,
means docker will distribute tasks among all nodes so by running
`node ps` you can see tasks on that node
