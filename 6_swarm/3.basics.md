## overlay networking

- it's a network driver type like bridge when we create a network

- it's designed for intra swarm communication

- it's scope is swarm

- it has optional IPSec (AES) which encrypts communication tunel between nodes

- when you create services, you can add them to one or multiple `overlay` network

### notes

- by default the swarm will create a network named `ingress` which uses
`overlay` network driver

- `docker network create --driver overlay`: creates `overlay` 
network driver and will create swarm-wide bridge network
