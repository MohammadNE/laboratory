## routing mesh

- it routes incoming (ingress) packets for a service to the proper node and task (container)

- spans (ranges) all nodes in swarm

- uses IPVS (IP Virtual Server) from linux Kernerl

- swarm puts VIP (virtual IP) in-front of all services in overlay network
and a service distributes the traffic (load) among all service-tasks

- the VIP maps to the DNS name of the service on overlay network

- if a task failed, swarm may create that in another node so there
is no need for DNS setting

- each node on swarm has a `swarm load balancer` which will load balance
the incomming traffic to the proper service-task inside ingress network.

### notes

- sometimes DNS cache prohibit us from properly distribute load

- routing mesh is a stateless load balancing

- routing mesh LB (load balancing) is at OSI layer 3 (TCP) not layer 4 (DNS)

- 2 above problems can be solved by HA-proxy

- you can assign multiple overlay network to a specific task
