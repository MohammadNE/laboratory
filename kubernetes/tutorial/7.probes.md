# Probes

- if application is malfunction, it's possible that pods are still running and will not restart.

- we should always expose health check to outside to check availability and resiliency of the app.

- we have 2 type of health checks:

  - `command`: running a command in the container periodically.

  - `URL`: periodic checks on a URL.

## readinessProbes

- when the pod has been scheduled and running, we perform some test named readinessProbes to ensure the application is ready to serve the requests, so the STATUS of the pod can be `Running` and the pod will not ready when the readinessProbes successed.

- if the check fails, the container will not be restarted, but the Pod's IP address will be removed from the service, so it'll not serve any requests more.

- the pod will be ready only after readinessProbe sucess signal.

- if we ommit the redinessProbe the pod will be ready just ofter being Runnning.

## livenessProbes (healthcheck of the application)

- indicate whether a container is running properly when the pod is ready.

- if check fails, the pod will be restarted

- if your container always exits when something goes wring, you don't need a livenessProbe.
