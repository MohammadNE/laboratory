# Networking

- we have discussed `container to container` (localhost), `pod to service` (DNS, ClusterIP) and `external to service` (NodePort, LoadBalancer, Ingress).

- pods have their own unique IP addresses and pods on different nodes need to communicate throw those IP addresses.

- some cloud providers deliver their own solutions but there are alternative approaches:

## CNI (container network interface)

- software that provides libraries/plugins for network interfaces within containers like `Calico` and `Weave`

## Overlay Network

- like the `Flannel`, in flannel the packets encapsulate source and destination IPs and the packet travels throw the actual physical network interface.
