# Resource Quota

> it's about resource managment

- you may want to be able to mange the reource of users and teams and you don't want one team or people uses all the resource of the cluster.

- we can achieve this by dividing cluster into namespaces and set some policies on them with `ResourceQuota` and `ObjectQuota`

## ResourceQuota

- it can be set on hardware resources per namespace like for request.cpu, request.mem, request.storage, limits.cpu and limits.memory

- `Request capacity` is minimum amount of resources the pod needs

- `Resource limit` is the container will not be able to use more resource than specified.

## ObjectQuota

- can be applied on total number of pods, configmaps, services, secrets and etc.
