# Ingress

- it's a solution since k8s 1.1 that allows `inound` connections to the cluster

- it's an alternative to external `LoadBalancer` and `NodePort` which allows easily expose `services` that need to be accessible from outside to the cluster

- with ingress you can run your own ingress controller (LB) within the k8s cluster

- there are ingress controllers available but you can write your own as well

- when we connect to the port http (80) or https (443) the traffic follows to the ingress controller and based on its pod like `nginx ingress controller` it will route the traffic based on the defined roles.
