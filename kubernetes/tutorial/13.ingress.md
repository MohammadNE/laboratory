# Ingress

- it's a solution since k8s 1.1 that allows `inound` connections to the cluster

- it's an alternative to external `LoadBalancer` and `NodePort` which allows easily expose `services` that need to be accessible from outside to the cluster

- with ingress you can run your own ingress controller (LB) within the k8s cluster

- there are ingress controllers available but you can write your own as well

- when we connect to the port http (80) or https (443) the traffic follows to the ingress controller and based on its pod like `nginx ingress controller` it will route the traffic based on the defined roles.

## [External DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns)

- External DNS synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers.

- when you define your ingress rules, it will be passed to the ingress-controller alongside with the external-dns and the external dns will update the dns-records of the dns-provider (likw Route53) to the actual IPs to route them to the ingress service.

- on public cloud-providers, you can use the ingress controller to reduce the cost of LB and you can use 1 LB to capture all the external traffic and send it to ingress controller.

- the ingress controller can be configured to route the different traffic to all your apps based on HTTP(S) rules with hosts and prefixes
