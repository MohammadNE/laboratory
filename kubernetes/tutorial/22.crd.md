# CRD (Custom Resource Definition)

> extend the kubernetes API

- resources are collection of API objects, for example `deployment` is a built-in resource type which you create it on the cluster using kubectl

- as an administrator you can add CRDs to add extra functionality to your cluster

- operators are such example that extends k8s API with their own functionality
