# User Managment

## Normal User

> used to access the user externally (kubectl)

- this user isn't managed using objects

- they have the following attributes:
  - username
  - UID
  - groups
  - extra fields

- there are multiple `authentication` strategies:
  - client certificates
  - bearer tokens
  - authenticaten proxies
  - HTTP basic authentication
  - OpenID
  - webhooks

- to limit access of users, we need to configure authorization after authentication
  - AlwaysAllow/AlwaysDeny
  - ABAC (attribute based access control)
  - RBAC (role based access control)
  - webhook (authorization by remote service)

## Service User

> used to authenticate within the cluster (inside a pod or kubelet)

- managed by an object in k8s and they are specific to namespaces

- using service account tokens which are stored as credentials using secrets

- they are created manually using objects or automatically by the API

- any non-authenticated API call is considered as an anonymous user
