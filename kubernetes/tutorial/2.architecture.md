# Architecture

## master node(s) / Control Plane(s)

### API server

> you and other master node(s) communicate with

### Scheduler

> schedule apps on appropriate worker nodes.

### Controller Manager

> cluster-level functions like keep track and manage worker nodes, handle node failure and etc.

### ETCD

> data store that persist cluster configurations.

## worker node(s)

### kube-proxy

> route external traffic to the pods.
>
> every worker node has an iptable which keep track of the pods and feeded by the kube-proxy

### kubelet

> takes commands from API server and manage pods and containers via container runtime (like rkt and docker)
