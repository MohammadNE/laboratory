# Volumes

- volumes allows us to store data outside the container itself.

- in stateless apps, when a container stops, all the container data in container would be lost.

- stateless apps can store their state inside external services like databases.

- `persistent volumes` in kubernetes allow you attach a volume to a container that exists even when the container stops.

- volumes can be attached using different volume plugins.

- using volumes you can deploy applications with state on your cluster.

- if your node stops working, the pod can be rescheduled on another node and the volume can be attached to the new pod.

- the kubernetes plugins have the capability to provision storage for you like AWS plugin which provision storage for you by creating the volumes in AWS before attaching them to a node, this is done in `StorageClass` object.

- kubernetes will provision volume automatically when you specify `StorageClass`, then you should declare a `PersistentVolumeClaim` and specify the size (with appropriate storage-class annotation).
