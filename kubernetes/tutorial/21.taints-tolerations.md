# Taints Tolerations

- `toleration` is the opposite of node affinity

- `toleration` allow a node to repel a set of pods

- `taints` mark a node

to make sure no pods will be scheduled on node1 (as long as they don't have a matching toleration)

``` bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule
```

the following toleraion allows a new pod scheduled on the taint node1

``` yml
tolerations:
- key: "key"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

## taint types

- NoSchedule: a hard requirement that a pod will not be scheduled unless there is a matching toleration

- PreferNoSchedule: soft requirement

- NoExecute: evict pods with non matching tolerations

## usecases

- for master node

- taint nodes that are dedicated for a team or a user

- taint some nodes to avoid running non-specific applications on those nodes.

- tiant the nodes by condition

## example

``` yml
tolerations:
- key: "node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unreachable"
  operator: "Exist"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 6000
```

## taints

- "node.alpha.kubernetes.io/not-ready": node is not ready
- "node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unreachable": node is unreachable from the controller
- "node.alpha.kubernetes.io/out-of-disk"
- "node.alpha.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure"
- "node.alpha.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure"
- "node.alpha.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable"
- "node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unschedulable"
