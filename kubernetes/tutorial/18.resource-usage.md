# Resource Usage

## Heapster

- it enables container cluster monitoring and performance analysis.

- it's a prerequisite if you want to do pod auto-scaling in k8s

- exports cluster metrics via REST endpoints

- you can use different backends (where data is stored) with it like `InfluxDB` (time series db)

- visualizations can be shown using `grafana`, also k8s own dashboard can show the graphs

- all these techs like heapster, influxDB and grafana can be started in pods

- the outputs of metrics are scrapped via `cAdvisor` and sended to `Heapster Pod` via the `kubelet`, the data of `Heapster` are stored in `InfluxDB` and you can query it using `grafana`.

## Metric server

- the `heapster` is now deprecated and instead, k8s uses `metric server`

``` bash
kubectl top node
kubectl top pod
```
