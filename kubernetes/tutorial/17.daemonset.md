# Daemon Sets

- ensure that every single node in k8s cluster runs the same pod resource

- this is useful if you want to ensure that a certain pod is running on every single kuberntes node.

- when a node is added to the cluster, a new pod will be started automatically.

- same when a node is removed, the pod will not be rescheduled on another node (node related).

- some usecases:
  - logging aggregators
  - monitoring
  - load balancers, reverse proxies, API gateways
  - running a daemon that needs 1 instance per physical instance.
