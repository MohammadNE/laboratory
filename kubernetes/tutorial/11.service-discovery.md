# Service Discovery

- as k8s 1.3, DNS is a built-in `service` launched automatically using `addons` manager.

- the `addons` are in the `/etc/kubernetes/addons` directory on `master` node.

- DNS service can be used within pods to find other services running on the same cluster.

- multiple containers in a pod don't need this service as they can contact each other directly under the same wing via localhost:port (only port should be known) means they are on the same subnet and they share the same port space and use the same network loopback interface.

- (important) to make `DNS work`, pods need `service` definition

- service discovery uses the name of the service to find ip address of the pod, also the built-in service discovery can do a `dns lookup` to find out IP of other pods by doing a `host service-name.default`, the default here means default namespace.

- (intersting), if you run a `busybox` as a testing container and do `cat /etc/resolv.conf` you will then see `nameserver 10.0.0.10` which points to the `dns-server` which behind the scene which is the default dns-server in k8s, it points to a pod named `kube-dns`
in the `kube-system` namespace.
