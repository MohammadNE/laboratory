# Pod Security Policy

> enables to control the security aspects of the pod creation and update.

- it'll invoked at pod creation and modification

## examples

- deny using privileged mode in pods
- control what volumes can be mount
- control containers UID/GID range (or make sure containers can't run as root)

## [demo](https://github.com/wardviaene/kubernetes-course/tree/master/pod-security-policies)

- we need at least 2 PodSecurityPolicies:
  - system processes (which needs to run as root)
  - user pods with tighter policies
