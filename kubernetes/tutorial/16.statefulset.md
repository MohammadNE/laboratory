# Stateful Sets

- with it your pods have a sticky identity using an index (keeping the identity on resechuling).

- StatefulSet allow apps stable storage with volumes based on their ordinal number

- deleting and scaling down will not delete the volumes associated with the StatefulSet object.

- a stateful will allow your stateful a[[ to use DNS to find other peers, for example cassandra clusters, ElasticSearch clusters use DNS to find other members of the cluster.

- without statefulSet, you would get a dynamic hostname which you wouldn't able to use in your config files as the name can always change.

- a StatefulSet will also allow your stateful app to order the startup and teardown:
  - scaling up: goes from 0 to n-1
  - scaling down: starts with highest number
