# Deployment

- it gives you more possibilities to manage k8s resources like Creating, Updating, rolling-updates (zero downtime), roll-back to previous versions, pause/resume a deployment and etc.

- you can manage the lifecycle of the app lot better rather than rc or rs.

- deployment uses rs (replication set) rather than rc (replication controller).
