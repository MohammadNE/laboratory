# Deployment

- it gives you more possibilities to manage k8s resources like Creating, Updating, rolling-updates (zero downtime), roll-back to previous versions, pause/resume a deployment and etc.

- you can manage the lifecycle of the app lot better rather than rc or rs.

- deployment uses rs (replication set) rather than rc (replication controller).

## useful commands

``` bash
# get information about current deployment
kubectl get deployments

# get information about replica set
kubectl get rs

# get deployment status
kubectl rollout status deployment deployment-name

# change runtime image
kubectl set image deployment deployment-name container-name=image-name

# edit deployment object
kubectl edit deployment deployment-name

# get status of the rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment deployment-name

# get rollout history
kubectl rollout history deployment deployment-name

# rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment deployment-name

# rollback to any version
kubectl rollout undo deployment deployment-name --to-revision=n
```
