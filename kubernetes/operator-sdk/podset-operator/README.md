# podset operator

podset operator is a golang operator to demystify the kubernetes operators and to get an overview of the operators developed by `operator framework`.

## Description

podset operator behaves very like the replica-set, created for learning purposes.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

## Running

``` bash
# scaffold project
operator-sdk init --project-name podset-operator --domain=example.com --repo=github.com/mohammadne/sandbox/podset-operator

# https://book.kubebuilder.io/migration/multi-group.html
kubebuilder edit --multigroup=true

# create api
operator-sdk create api --group=app --version=v1alpha1 --kind=PodSet --controller --resource

# make changes to the api
vim api/v1alpha1/podset_type.go

# update the api/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go
make generate

# generate the CRD manifests at config/crd/bases/app.example.com_podsets.yaml
make manifest

# make changes to the controller
vim controllers/podset_controller.go

# run operator locally outside the cluster
make install run # first terminal
kubectl create -f config/samples/app_v1alpha1_podset.yaml # second terminal
kubectl get podset
kubectl get podset podset-sample -o yaml
kubectl get pods podset-sample-podqzwql -o yaml | grep ownerReferences -A5
kubectl patch podset podset-sample --type='json' -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/replicas", "value": 5}]'
kubectl get pods
kubectl delete podsets.app.example.com podset-sample
make uninstall

# push operator image to registry
vim Makefile # update IMAGE_TAG_BASE
make docker-build docker-push

# run operator inside the cluster
make deploy
kubectl apply -f config/samples/app_v1alpha1_podset.yaml
make undeploy

```

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

    ```sh
    make install
    ```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

    ```sh
    make run
    ```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
