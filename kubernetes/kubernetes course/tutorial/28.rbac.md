# RBAC

- [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keoYFZhtg0U&ab_channel=GeertBaeke)

## API server access flow

1. authentication -> service accounts

2. authorization -> roles and role-bindings

3. admission controls

## Authorization

> controls what a user can do and where does a user have access to

- access control will be done on API level

- there are multiple authorization modules available:
  - Node: authorize API requests with kubelets
  - ABAC: controled by policies that combine attributes but not allow very granular permission control
  - RBAC: regulate aceess using roles
  - allows admin dynamically configure permission policies
  - Webhook: send authorization requests to an external REST interface (authorization server)

- to enable authorization mode we need to pass `--authorization-mode=`

- we first define a `role` and then bind a `user/group` to that role

- `roles` can be ties to a namespace or applied to all namespaces, there are 2 resource type names `Role` and `ClusterRole` for roles and `RoleBinding` and `ClusterRoleBinding` for `user/group` that are bind to roles.

- to see some examples refer to the [kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) and [here](https://github.com/wardviaene/kubernetes-course/tree/master/users)
