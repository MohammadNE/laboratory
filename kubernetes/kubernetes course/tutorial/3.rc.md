# Replication Controller

- you can scale stateless applications horizontly

- stateless means application doesn't have any state and it doesn't write any local files

- all traditional databases are stateful and we can run them in a single container and `vertically` scale that by allocating CPU, memory, disk and etc .

- most web apps can be made stateless and session managment part needs to be done outside of the container and files shouldn't be saved locally on the container and we should use volumes for them.

- it's recommended using it to make sure 1 pod is always running even after reboots.

- scaling in k8s can be done throw the `Replication Controller` objects and it will ensure the number of pod replicas.

- `Replication Set` is the next-generation of `Replication Controller` which comes with a more complex selector pattern matching (filtering).
