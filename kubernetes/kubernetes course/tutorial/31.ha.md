# HA (high availability)

if you are going in production, you want your master services in a HA setup

- clustering etcd with at least 3 nodes
- replicated API servers with a loadbalancer
- running multiple schedulers and controllers (only 1 of them is the leader and the rest are sandby)

the `kops` will do the heavy lifting for you or you can use a `kube deployment tool` like `kubeadm`
