- the `node controller` is responsible to observe node objects

- a new node automatically created with :
  - `metadata` like name, IP and hostname
  - `labels` like region, zone and etc.

- you want gracefully decommit a node (drain before shutdown)

- to drain a node

    ``` bash
    kubectl drain nodename --grace-period=600
    ```
