# Pod presets

- pod presets can inject information into pods at runtime.

- they used to inject kuberntes resources like secrets, configMaps, volumes and environment variables.

- you can use it to create 1 preset object to inject environment variables or config files to all matching pods.

- when injecting `variables` and `VolumeMounts`, the pod preset will apply the changes to all containers within the pod.
