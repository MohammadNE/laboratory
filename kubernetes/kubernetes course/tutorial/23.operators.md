# Operators

> it's a method of packaging, deploying and managing a k8s applicaiton

- it puts operational knowlwdge in an application

- it brings the user closer to the experience of managed cloud services rather than having to know all the specifics of an application deployed to k8s.

- the operators are managed by CRDs (custom resource definitions)

- it's a great way to deploy stateful services on k8s (because of complexities)

- with postgresql container, you would only start the database

- with postgresql operator, you can create, replicate, scale, initiate and etc.

- an operator contains a lot of managment logic that you as a user want rather having to implement them yourself.
