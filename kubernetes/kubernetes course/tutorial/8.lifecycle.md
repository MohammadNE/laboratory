# Lifecycle

## pod status

``` bash
# a high level status which you can see pods status (starting, restarting, ...)
kubectl get pods
```

- `running`: pod has been bound to a node and all containers have been created and at least one container is running.

- `pending`: pods are accepted but not running, like when downloading image or because of resource constarints.

- `succeeded`: all containers within pod have been terminated with ok status code and will not be restarted

- `failed`: all containers within pod have been terminated but at least one returned by failure code

- `unknown`: the state of the pod couldn't be determined like a network issue

## pod condition

``` bash
# shows conditions which the pod has passed
kubectl describe pod pod-name
```

- `Initialized`: the initialization containers have been started succesfully

- `Ready`: pod can serve requests

- `ContainersReady`: all containers in the pod are ready

- `PodScheduled`: the pod has been scheduled to a node

- `Unschedulable`: the Pod can't be scheduled (ex: resource constraints)

## container state

``` bash
# state of containers reported from docker itself
kubectl get pod <name> -n kubesystem --output=yaml
```

- `waiting`

- `running`

- `terminated`

## pod lifecycle

- init container: the initialization container before the main container to do some setups

- `hooks` are some more commands when main container wants to start and terminate (executed inside main container).

  - post start hook: initialization of the main container (executed at the startup)

  - pre start hook: termination of the main container (executed at the end to gracefully shut it down)
