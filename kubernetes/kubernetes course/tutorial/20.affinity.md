# Affinity / Anti Affinity

- it allows to do more complex scheduling than the nodeSelector and also works on pods

- create rules that are not hard requirements but rather a prefered rule, meaning that the scheduler will still be able to schedule your pod even if the rule cannot be met.

- this mechanism is only relevent during scheduling

## node affinity

> similar to `nodeSelector`

there are 2 types

### requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution

> the rule must be met befor the pod can be scheduled

### preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution

> tries to enforce the rule but it will not guarantee it (soft requirement)

- the `weighting` will be summed up to specify where the pod will be scheduled on

## pod affinity/anti-affinity

> allows you to create rules how pods should be scheduled taking into account other running pods

- pod anit-affinity allows you to create a rule that says to not schedule on the same host if a pod label matches

### usecase

- `co-located pods`

- co-locate pods with the same availability zone

we need to specify a `topology domain` called `topologyKey` in the rules.

- `topologyKey` refers to a node label

if the affinity rule matches, the new pod will only be scheduled on nodes that have the `same` topolgyKey value as the current running pod.

### requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution

> the rule must be met befor the pod can be scheduled

### preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
