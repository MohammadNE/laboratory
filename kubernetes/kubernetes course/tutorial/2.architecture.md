# Architecture

## master node(s) / Control Plane(s)

> set of servers and VMs to manage the whole cluster

### API server

> you and other master node(s) communicate with
>
> API server implements an interface, which means different tools and libraries can readily communicate with it.

### Scheduler

> schedule apps(pods) on appropriate worker nodes.

### Controller Manager

> cluster-level functions like keep track and manage worker nodes, handle node failure and etc.
>
> looks at state of whole cluster and everything in it and uses `API` to do that.
>
> it takes the orders that are giving to it named `specs` and determines the difference between what you're asking it to do and waht's actually going on then it figures out how to make changes


### ETCD

> data store that persist cluster configurations.
>
> it uses RAFT algorithm.

## worker node(s)

### kube-proxy

> control the networking and helps in making services and applications available to the external host.
>
> every worker node has an iptable which keep track of the pods and feeded by the kube-proxy.

### kubelet

> takes commands from API server (master node) and manage pods and containers via container runtime (like rkt and docker)
>
> It interacts with etcd store to read configuration details and wright values.
