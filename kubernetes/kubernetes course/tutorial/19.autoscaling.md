# Autoscaling

- k8s has the possiblity to automatically scale pods based on metrics

- k8s can automatically scal a deployment, replication controller or replicaset

- in k8s 1.3 scaling based on CPU usage is possible out of the box

- autoscalling periodically query the utilization for the targeted pods (default is 30 seconds)

- the HorizontalPodAutoscaler is implemented as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller.

- The resource determines the behavior of the controller.

## work around

``` yml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: php-apache
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: php-apache
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50 # 50 percent of request cpu resourse
```

## how scaling works?

> with `targetCPUUtilizationPercentage` we determine a percentage and if the usage is higher than this value, a new pod will be created until we reach `maxReplicas`, also if the usage is lesser than this value the replicaas would be decreased up until `minReplicas`
