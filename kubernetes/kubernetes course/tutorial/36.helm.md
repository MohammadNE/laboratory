# HELM

> package manager for kubernetes

- to use helm in kubernetes cluster we should:
  - initialize helm (installs tiller)
  - if you have RBAC installed, you also need to add a ServiceAccount and RBAC rules.

- it uses helm packaging format

- a chart is a collection of files that describe a set of k8s resources

- charts are template that accept conditions, variables, loops and etc.

- we can setup s3 helm repository

- it's also possible to deploy helm charts via CI/CD tools like jenkines, the wardviaene created a repo for jenkines which is very beautiful (it will do the works inside a pod with a certain serviceaccount)
