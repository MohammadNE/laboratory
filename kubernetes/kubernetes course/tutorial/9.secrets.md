# Secrets

- provides a way in k8s to distribute credentials, keys, passwords or any secret data to the pods.

- k8s internally uses this secrets mechanism to provide the credentials to access the internal API in the `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount`

- secrets (k8s's secret) isn't the only way to provide secrets, it's native to k8s but there are still other ways your container can get secrets like an external `vault` service.

## using secrets (ways)

1. you can use them as `environment variables`

2. use secrets as a `file` in a pod, it uses volumes to be mounted in a container and in this volume you have files that can be used for instance for `dotenv` files or your app can just read this file.

3. use an `external image` to pull secrets (from private image-registry)

## generate secrets (files)

1. using `command-line`

2. using `yaml` (base64 encoded values)

## use secrets

1. create a pod that exposes the secrets as environment variables

2. provide it as a file:

- the dafault k8s uses this mechanism to provide secrets
