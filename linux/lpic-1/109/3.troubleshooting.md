``` bash
netstat -ul # list udp services
netstat -tl # list tcp services
netstat -putl # 
netstat -r # routing table
```

## ss

> stands for socket statistics
>
> modern replacement for netstat, it doesn't show the routing table

## nc

> netcat is a network utility tool to test connectivity on machines

## telnet
