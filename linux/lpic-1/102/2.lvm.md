# LVM (Logical Volume Manager)

> allows creation of `groups` of disks or partitions that can be assembled into a single (or multiple) filesystems.

- can be used for any mount point except the `/boot` because the GRUB can't understand it.

- flexibility which allows resizing the volumes

- snapshots, point in time copy (backup) of your logical volume

## layout

- at the bottom we have `PV` or physical volumes or hard disks like sda, sdb and sdc.
- above the `PV` we put the `VG` or volume group for example we name it base_vg.
- above the `VG` we put our `LV` or logical volumes like lv_root, lv_swap and- s lv_home.
- then on top of `LV` we mount them to the actual filesystem like lv_root mounts to the root fs.
