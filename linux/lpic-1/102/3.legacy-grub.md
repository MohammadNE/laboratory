# Legacy GRUB

let's talk about the process in legacy GRUB:

1. the `BIOS` first check everything out.
2. the first 512 bytes of the hard disk is the `MBR` partition which contains the `boot.img`
3. the GRUB boot loader contains a small image file named `boot.img` which refers to the `core.img` file
4. the point for `boot.img` is to refer to the `core.img` file.
5. the point with `core.img` is to locate the actual boot partition of the system in `/boot/grub`

- the `/boot/grub` contains 2 important files:
  - `grub.conf` (redhat based) or `menue.lst` (debian based): which contains information about the GRUB
  - `device.map`: indicate which drive contains actual kernel and OS that needs to be booted, after these process the GRUB will load the kernel.
