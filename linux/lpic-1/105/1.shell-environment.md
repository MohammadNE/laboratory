# Shell Environment

- 2 main types of shell environments
  - interactive login shell
    - created when you log into a console
    - created when logged in remotely via SSH
  - interactive non-login shell
    - created when a terminal application like `GNOME terminal` is started

- to find out on which shell you are, type `echo $0`, the login shell starts with `-` but the non-login shell starts without `-`.

## interactive login shell

- have a main script named `/etc/profile` which calls any additional scripts from `/etc/profile.d/*` and at the end calls the `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` at home directory.

- the `~/.bash_profile` then calls the `~/.bashrc` file and it will calls `/etc/bashrc` file to pull out system information

## interactive non-login shell

- first calls the `~/.bashrc` file and it will calls `/etc/bashrc` file to pull out system information

## commands

### /etc/profile

> the first file read on a login session. sets up system-wide environment variables, umask values, bash history controls and etc.

### /etc/profile.d/

> contains extra scripts configuration files for bash
>
> the `/etc/profile` will read in contents of this directory

### ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile

> contains user local PATH environment and sources `~/.bashrc`

### ~/.bashrc

> local user specific setup like own aliases and functions sits here, also it calls (sources) the `/etc/bashrc`

### /etc/bashrc

> configure system-wide functions and aliases there.

### ~/.bash_logout

> any cleanup activity, killing a process, print logout message and etc.

### /etc/skel/

> contains default home bash scripts that are added to a user's home directory when an account is created on the system.
