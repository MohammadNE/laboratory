# Shell Scripts

- reduce repetitive work and automate the tasks

- normally ends in `.sh` extension or without eny extension

- to get the last application status run `echo $?` in terminal

## Basics Concepts

### shebang (#!)

> sequence can be used at the begining of any scripts (python, bash and etc), this sequence tells the system that the file is a script.
>
> the actual script interpreter follows the shebang sequnce.
>
> the shebang sequnce is needed because the extension to the files are convention and it can be anything.

### comment (#)

> the comment sequence.

### commands

> if you can run a command in a Bash prompt, then you can put it in a Bash script file.

### permissions

> script files must have the execute permission set on them in order to be used

- `chmod u+x script_name` to make the file executable

### parameters or arguments

> items that get passed to the shell script, the shell script acts on these paramertes
>
> each paramerter is positional meands that the location of the parameter determines the value of the variable that is assigned to it

## Adding Logic To Scripts

### if, elif, else

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -d /opt ]; then
    echo "/opt exists"
elif [ -f /etc/fstab ]; then
    echo "/opt doesn't exists but /etc/fstab file exists"
elif test -f /etc/hosts; then
    echo "/opt and /etc/fstab doesn't exists but /etc/hosts file exists"
else
    echo "non of the files and directories mentioned abobe exists"
fi
```

### test

> used to test for various condition

- using `[[ ]]` (2 brackets) allows to have logical operators within the brackets but with `[]` (single brackets) you have to move your logical operators outside of the brackets.

    ``` bash
    if [[ -d /opt || -f ~/derp ]]; then
        echo "OK"
    fi
    # same as
    if [ -d /opt ] || [ -f ~/derp ]; then
        echo "OK"
    fi
    ```

- the `[[ ]]` also allows file globbing and regular expressions.

### ||

> indicates a logical OR operator

### &&

> indicates a logical AND operator

### =

> equal sign conditional expression

### !=

> inequality sign conditional expression

### testing integers

> these are all conditional expressions

- `-eq` equality between 2 numbers

- `-ne` inequality between 2 numbers

- `-gt` tests if one number value is higher than another

- `-ge` tests if one number value is higher or equal than another

- `-lt` tests if one number values is lesser than another

- `-le` tests if one number values is lesser or equal than another

``` bash
if [ $? -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "something went wrong with the previoud command"
fi
```
