> it's a protocol by X.org foundation provides graphical rendering for UNIX-like OSs

- core display server system that provides the protocol service for the X window system

- provides extra functionality via extensions such as
  - `RandR`: provides dynamic resizing of the root window, refresh rates, mirrorig displays and etc.
  - `GLX`: provides rendering of 3D openGL content within windows
  - `Xinerama`: provides the ability to split the desktop display across multiple monitors

## architecure

1. graphical cards
2. linux kernel and graphic driver
3. libDRM
4. X server (/etc/x11/xorg.conf)
5. Xlib/XCB
6. Display manager (GNOME, KDE, Xfce and etc)
7. applications

## installation

``` bash
yum group list
yum -y groupinstall "X Window System"
telinit 5 # on old init systems

telinit 4
startx
```

- in old init systems
    - at the bottom of `/etc/inittab` file, there's a line to run X11 in runlevel 5, the `/etc/X11/prefdm` file
    - in `/etc/X11/prefdm` file, we choose prefered display manager (with it's order)

- in modern systemd systems
  - run `systemctl get-default` to get default target
  - run `cat /etc/systemd/system/dafault.target` to see default target script
  - in graphical target, the unit wants the `display-manager.service`
  - run `cat /etc/systemd/system/display-manager.service` to see ExecStart display manager like `/usr/sbin/gdm`
