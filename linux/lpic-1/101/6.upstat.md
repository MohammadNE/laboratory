# upstart

- first developed for ubuntu in 2006 (in ubuntu 6.10) and then used by redhat distributions.

- unlike init, upstart offers asynchronous starting the devices and decrease the boot time.

- upstart also monitors the services and handles the failures.

- upsert uses its mechanism to monitor modifications, each change triggers and event and every event triggers a job, the job has 2 types:
  - task: a script that runs and ends when it finished.
  - service: an independnet running service.
