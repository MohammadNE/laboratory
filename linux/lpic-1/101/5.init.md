# Init

- short for initialization

- based off of the `sysvinit(system v init)` in unix systems.

- in init and sysvinit the services started one after another (serial) to keep things simple enough.

- as we said, the kernel will boots up the init system, the default location of the init is in `/sbin/init` and it will take the configurations from the `etc/inittab`.

- the system will operate at a one level at any time:
  0. halt: or shutdown the init will terminate all the services
  1. single user mode: the root user is the only user allowed to logged to the system
  2. multiuser mode without network: used for multiple user with no network interface
  3. multiuser mode with network: used for multiple user with network interface, default of the servers
  4. unused: in order to sysadmins create a new custom level
  5. multi-user with network and GUI: default of the system with desktp nvironments
  6. reboot: when init stops and restart the system

- in `/etc/inittab` we have a line in this format: `<identifier>:<runlevel>:<action>:<process>` which indicates on which runlevel do what action on which process.
