# Boot Sequence

1. after a computer starts, the `BIOS/Firmware or EFI/UEFI` on the motherboard checks all the hardwareand input/output devices and after that, the boot process can begin.

2. after that the boot program name `GRUB (grand unified boot loader)` will look at a section of hard drive that contains the data needed to boot the OS.

3. the boot loader (GRUB) then boots the kernel.

4. the kernel loads initial RAM disk which contains a bunch of device drivers and starts to load the computer device drivers to mount the filesystem from the hard disk.

5. then the kernel starts the system initialization (init).

6. the initial RAM is unneeded and will be removed.

7. the init will load proccesses and deamons needed in the system

## Boot Logs

> the logs generated when the system boots up.
>
> these logs are generated from an area called `ring buffer`, which is an area of RAM which kernel write all of its system messages to

### dmesg

> the traditional (legacy) utility used for viewing the kernel ring buffer.

### journalctl -k

> systemd utility to view the kernel ring buffer within the systemd journal.
>
> systemd is the linux init system and comes with `journalctl` command which logs every log that goes within the computer.
