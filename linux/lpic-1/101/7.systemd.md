# systemd

- init and upsert rely on bash shell scripts and systemd tries to replace most of them with C codes but still compatible with older systems.

- systemd utilize `unit` files.

- location of the unit files:
  - `/usr/lib/systemd/system`: unit files provided by package manager
  - `/etc/systemd/system`: unit files provided by sysadmins
  - `/run/systemd/system`: runtime unit files
  
- view all unit files: `systemctl list-unit-files`

- to see contents of some units: `systemctl cat name.unit`

- [components of the unit files](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files)

## target unit

> a unit that syncs up other unitswhen the computer boots or changes state
>
> often used to bring the system to a new state like: multi-user.taget or graphical.target

- to see important targets like graphical target: `systemctl cat graphical.target`

- type of targets:
  - multi-user.target: similar to runlevel 3
  - graphical-user.target: similar to runlevel 5
  - rescue.target: pulls in basic system and file system mounts and provides a rescue shell
  - basic.target: basic system boot up
  - sysint.target: system initialization
  
## target commands

## systemctl get-default

> to see your current target

## systemctl set-default target

> change default target

### systemctl isolate target

> will change the running state of the system from the current target to a different target

### systemctl rescue

> almost identical to the system V init single-user mode which allows the root user to repair the system

### systemctl reboot

> run the reboot.target, same as typing reboot

### systemctl poweroff

> perform a complete shutdown, same as typing poweroff
