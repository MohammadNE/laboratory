## configuration files

### /etc/passwd

> flat file database that contains info about users and system accounts
>
> an example would be: `root:*:0:0:System Administrator:/var/root:/bin/sh` which indicates user `root` has `*` encrypted password with user id `0`, primary group id of `0`, the comment is `System Administrator`, the home directory for root user id `/var/root` and the user shell environment is `/bin/sh`

- some users have `nologin` shell which indicates they shouldn't be used to loggind to the system.

- regular user account ids are above 1000.

### /etc/shdow

> this file includesencrypted passwords for accounts in `/etc/passwd`
>
> similar to the `/etc/passwd` file, the second part between `:` indicates the the algorithm, salt and the hashed value (between 2 `$`s)

### /etc/group

> contains group definition along with members belong to each group

### /etc/skel

> items that will be added to a new user home directory when the account is created.

### /etc/default/useradd

> referenced by `useradd` when a new user account is created.

### /etc/login.defs

> actual values for user and group ids to ovverride `/etc/default/useradd` file

### getent

> used to query a DB for information about a user or group

``` bash
getent passwd kenny
getent group 1
```
