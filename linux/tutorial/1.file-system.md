# File System

- a regular file system is a method of laying out files and directories on a physical hard disk.

- in linux directories are also files.

- in linux all the hard drive itself, network cards, keyboard, monitors and etc are seen as files in linux.

- a `psudo files system` doesn't existson a physical hard disk and exists only in RAM when system is booted up, the psudo means not real and the information will be wiped out when the system is booted off.

- the kernel is responsible to create psudo file systems.

## /sys
