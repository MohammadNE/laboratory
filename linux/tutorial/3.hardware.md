# Hardware

## /dev

> a psudo file system that contains information about all the connected hardwares on a system

- if you get `ls` there, we can see cpu, hard disks, memory, video cards, network information and bunch of `tty`s that are terminals fired up on the system.

## udev

> the device manager for the Linux kernel, links information on system harwdware to /dev

## D-Bus

> sends data messages between applications
>
> it's a conduit of information about what is going in the system
>
> udev use it to notify users and the system when new hardware is attached

- when we adding a new hard drive, the udev service will detect it and add it to the `/dev` which is for devices.

- there are some handy commands to work with `/dev` and display their information in human readable format.
