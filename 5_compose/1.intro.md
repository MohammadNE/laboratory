it's command line tool and a configuration file together

## why
- configure relationships between containers
- save our docker container run settings in easy-to-read file
- create one-liner developer environment startups

### note
- comprised of 2 things:
1. YAML-file that describes options for : containers, networks, volumes
2. CLI tool `docker-compose` used for local dev/test automation with above YAML-file
