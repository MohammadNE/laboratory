# Networking

## concepts

### IP

> IP address stands for Internet Protocol Address. It is a logical address that helps to connect devices to the network. Moreover, it is possible to assign IP addresses manually or dynamically.
>
> There are two IP addressing versions as IPv4 and IPv6. The most common IP address version is IPv4. It is a 32bit address that has 4 bytes; each byte is an octet.

### hostname

> A host name is a combination of the name of your machine and a domain name (e.g. machinename.domain.com). The purpose of a host name is readability.
>
> it's much easier to remember than an IP address. All hostnames resolve to IP addresses, so in many instances they are talked about like they are interchangeable.
>
> When the user visits a certain website or a web page, the web address or the location is displayed on top of the web browser.  This address is also known as the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). For example, assume www.microsoft.com. Here, the www section is the hostname. It specifies the network the user should visit in order to go to the website Microsoft.com.

### Domain Name

> while The hostname represents the network or system used to deliver a user to a certain address or location, The domain name represents the site or project that the user is accessing.

### DNS

> DNS servers convert URLs and domain names into IP addresses that computers can understand and use. They translate what a user types into a browser into something the machine can use to find a webpage. This process of translation and lookup is called DNS resolution.
>
> to fully understand how DNS resolves, you should be familiar with zones and delegations and how your ISP will ask the DNS servers to resolve a URL (Domain Name + hostname)
