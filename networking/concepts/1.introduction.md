# Introduction

a `computer network` is 2 or more computers connected together

## usecases

- exchanging data (files, programs)
- sharing resources (printers)
- communication (chat, email)

## types

- `LAN` : a network that connects devices in a limited area.
- `WAN` : connect smaller LAN networks together.

## topologies

> describes how devices on a network relate to each other either physically or logically (data flows).

- `Ring` : circular network flow
- `Point To Point` : link computers directly
- `Mesh` : connect every computer to each other
- `Star` : a hub in between is the connection node and all computer connects to that hub.
- `BUS` : all computers connected throw a single cable.
- `Tree` : tree shape connection between computers.
- `Hybrid` : mix of above topologies

## bulding blocks of networking

- `Devices` : every device has a unique MAC address that network traffic can be propagate based on that.
- `Connections` : how every computer connects to the network (cables or wireless).
- `Switches` : a device that connects devices on the network to each other.
- `Routers` : directs traffic from 1 network to another network. (like from 1 LAN to another LAN).
- `Servers` : endpoints on the network that deliver something.

## internet

it's considered to be the largest WAN and is composed of many public and private networks all over the globe.
