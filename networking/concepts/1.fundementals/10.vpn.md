# VPN (Virtual Private Network)

Extension of private networks using the IP connectivity of the internet to connect to remote clients to remote sites in an encrypted private connection.

## uses

- secure private network traffic over an insecure public network for example working from a coffeshop and you want to encrypt your network data from coffeshop ISP guy.

- working remotely, connections to an internal corporate resource from a remote location.

- connect 2 seperated private networks together.

## tunneling

- permits the encapsulation of one type of protocol packing within the datagram of a different protocol for instance sending TCP/IP traffic over the internet.

- for PPTP and L2TP (layer 2 tunneling protocol), a tunnel is similar to a session, each end of the tunnel must agree to the connection and will negotiate configuration variables such as address assignment, encryption and compression parameters.

- the data can be send only after tunnel establishment, when client tunnel send data to server tunnel, the tunnel client appends a tunnel data transfer protocol header to the payload. the client then sends the encapsulated and encrypted data to the tunnel server, the tunnel server accepts data, removes the tunnel data and forwards the payload to the destination network within the VPN.
