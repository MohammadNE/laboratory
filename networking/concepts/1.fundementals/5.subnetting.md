# Subnetting

A way to devide larger networks into smaller networks which seperates the IP into network and host adresses.

- makes networks easier to manage

- better allocation of IP addresses in a limited range

- improves network performance.

- for example 192.168 is the `network`, the third octets are the `subnet` numbers (1,2) and the last octets are the `hosts` (1,2).

- when we seperate a network (private one) into multiple subnets, each subnet has a seperate network (hence network-id and broadcast ip)

- <https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/7106/how-do-you-calculate-the-prefix-network-subnet-and-host-numbers>

- the network 172.10.21.21/24
  - it's a class B network
  - and the `subnet mask` has borrowed 8 bits from the third octet so the network is 172.10.0.0/16
  - the subnets are 172.10.1.0/24, 172.10.2.0/24 and etc
  - 172.10.1.0/24 is one of the subnets

- the 10.210.170.255/23
  - subnets are from 10.0.0.0/23 to 10.255.254.0/23
  - the first subnet has network ID of 10.0.0.0 and broadcast id of 10.0.1.255
  - one of the subnets are 10.210.170.0/23

## Supernetting

It's opposite of subnetting (break large network into multiple smaller networks) and is about aggregating multiple networks into larger networks.

- suppose 172.168.197.0/24, 172.168.198.0/24, 172.168.200.0/24, 172.168.202.0/24, 172.168.206.0/24 networks and combine them into a larger network -> 172.168.192.0/20 (counts the bits in common)

## Private IP

## NAT
