# TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- layer 4 (transport) protocol alongside UDP

- it's a highly reliable protocol through PAR (Positive Acknowledgment with Retransmission)

- data is re-sent if an acknowledgment isn't recieved

- the layer 4 data refered to `segments`, each segment contains a `checksum` for verification upong receipt
  - if verification suceeds, an ACK is sent
  - is it fails, the reciever discards the segment and waits for retransmission

## TCP handshake

A 3-way handshake used for setting up a reliable connection
