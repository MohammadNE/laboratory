# ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

Communication protocol used for discovering the MAC address associated with a given IP address.

Simply ARP is used for mapping an IP address to a MAC address on the network

- the layer 3 header contains source and destination IP.

- the layer 2 header created with source and destination MAC address.

- here the ARP request (Broadcast) will be created to find out MAC of the requested IP and the destination will send a ARP response (Unicast) to the source IP address.

- if the destination is outside of the local network, it'll request the MAC of the default gateway.

``` bash
# setup 2 VMs on the same network

# show ARP table (n stands for neighbours)
ip n

# from 1 VM, ping another one
ping -c1 192.168.1.196

# now the ARP table has the mapping of MAC addresses to IPs
ip n
```

## MAC address

Unique fingerprint of the network interface
