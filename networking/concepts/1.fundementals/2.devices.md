# Devices

- there are multiple switches and routers between the source and destination.

- cloud networking is a software defined simulation of a traditional network.

## switches

- switch will be uses in the LAN.

- switches facilitate internal network traffic

## routers

- the router is connected to the internet and is the internet gateway for the LAN

- the path from the client to the gateway is the default route (includes the switch)

- routers facilitate traffic between networks.

## NIC

The point of interconnection between a computer and a private or public network. A `network interface` is generally a network interface card (NIC), but does not have to have a physical form. Instead, the network interface can be implemented in software named virtual network interface.

- `loopback inteface` : special virtual interface host uses to communicate to itself.

- the `loopback` doesn't use the NIC and instead uses `virtual network interface` from the OS.
