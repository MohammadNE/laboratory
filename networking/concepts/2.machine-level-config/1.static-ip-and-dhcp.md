# Static IP and DHCP

## static IP

- dedicated, unchanged IP addresses assigned to the device

- upon setting it, you must also specify the subnet, gateway and DNS host info

- used for important network devices and hosts that require absolute connectivity

### requirements

- IP address

- netmask

- gateway IP

- DNS host (optional)

- DNS domain (optional)

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- dynamic address assigned from a pool of IP addresses within the DHCP scope.

- DHCP will normally provide subnet, gateway and DNS info upon assigning IP address.

- typically used for host requiring transient connections or managing the IP addresses of a large number of hosts.

- DHCP `server` uses UDP port 67 and `clients` uses UDP port 68.

- DHCP request and offer are `layer 2` broadcasts (like ARP requests) and requires a running DHCP client.

- `DHCP lease` is a temporary assignment of an IP address to a device on the network.

### DHCP sequence

1. `DHCP discover`, the client broadcast a request looking for a host that can assign it an IP address

2. `DHCP offer`, DHCP server respond and offer an IP address

3. `DHCP request`, the client will request the offered address

4. `DHCP acknowledge`, the DHCP server will acknowledge that the IP address has been assigned

## commands

```bash
# view lease information on the host
cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases

# lookup DHCP host
sudo grep "DHCPOFFER" /var/log/messages

# show processes (sockets) listening on udp or tcp without resolving service names
ss -luntp | grep dhclient
```

``` bash
# show network interface controllers
nmcli

# brief list of connections
nmcli connection

# brief list of devices
nmcli device

# details about connection
nmcli c show <name-of-connection>
nmcli connection show <name-of-connection> | grep "ipv4.method"

# modify interface config
nmcli con mod <interface-name> ipv4.dns 192.168.1.1

# restart the connection with newest modifications
nmcli con down <interface-name>
nmcli con up <interface-name>

# change connection method from static to DHCP
nmcli con mod <interface-name> ipv4.method auto

# restart the connection with newst modifications
nmcli con down <interface-name>
nmcli con up <interface-name>
```

    ``` bash
    nmcli c

    # get static IP information
    # get DNS info (check if Shekan is set or not)
    nmcli d show <device-name>

    sudo nmcli c mod Heidar ipv4.method manual ipv4.adresses 192.168.1.184/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1 ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8 ipv4.dns-search ec2.internal

    nmcli c show Heidar | grep ipv4

    sudo systemctl restart network
    ```
