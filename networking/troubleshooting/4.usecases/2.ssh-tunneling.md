# SSH Tunneling

- [depic of ssh tunneling](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/115897/whats-ssh-port-forwarding-and-whats-the-difference-between-ssh-local-and-remot)

- [dynamic ssh tunneling](https://superuser.com/questions/271616/socks-vs-ssh-local-port-forwarding)

> here we have 2 servers, the server1 (10.0.1.10) is publicly available and server2 (10.0.1.20) is private in the VPC and accessible throw server1

## local ssh tunneling

> based on above depic, we use `ssh -L 8080:Server2:80 cloud_user@Server1` for local tunneling

### lab

- on server2 (10.0.1.20)

    ```bash
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule="rule family='ipv4' source address='10.0.1.11' reject"
    firewall-cmd --reload

    curl localhost
    ```

- on the client (10.0.1.11)

    ```bash
    curl 10.0.1.10
    curl 10.0.1.20

    ssh -L 8080:10.0.1.20:80 -L 80:10.0.1.10:80 cloud_user@10.0.1.10
    ss -lntp

    curl localhost:80
    # response from server1

    curl localhost:8080
    # response from server2
    ```

## remote ssh tunneling

> suppose your boss on server2 wants to check what you have done on your machine, we use the remote ssh as `ssh -R 8080:localhost:80 cloud_user@Server1` for remote tunneling which the boss can get the contents from port 8080 of the server1

### lab

- on client (10.0.1.11)

    ```bash
    # prohibit traffic from server2
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule="rule family='ipv4' source address='10.0.1.20' reject"
    firewall-cmd --reload

    curl localhost
    # client response

    ssh -R 8080:localhost:80 cloud_user@10.0.1.10
    ```

- on server1 (10.0.1.10)

    ```bash
    # uncomment 'GatewayPorts yes'
    vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    systemctl restart sshd
    ```

- on the server2 (10.0.1.20)

    ```bash
    curl localhost:8080
    # response from client
    ```


## dynamic ssh tunneling (real proxy server)

> the logged in intermediary server acts as the proxy, here we use `ssh -D 8080 cloud_user@Server1`
>
> we use dynamic tunneling when the destination is unknown
