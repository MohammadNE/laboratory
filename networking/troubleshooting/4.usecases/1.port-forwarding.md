- in port-forwarding we don't have any intermediary servers like what we have in `ssh tunneling`, `proxy` and `vpn`, we just change the firewall to indicate how to intercept routing policies.

## lab 1

> the server 1 hosting httpd on port 8080 and let's redirect traffic on port 80 to the port 8080

- with firewalld

    ``` bash
    # listen on port 8080 (on server 1)
    vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    systemctl restatrt httpd

    # Add the Forwarding Rule
    firewall-cmd --add-forward-port=port=80:proto=tcp:toport=8080
    ```

- with iptables

    ``` bash
    iptables -nL
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

    # accpet external traffic on port 8080
    iptables -L --line-number
    iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
    ```

## lab 2

- [what is masquerade](https://askubuntu.com/questions/466445/what-is-masquerade-in-the-context-of-iptables)

- using firewalld

    ``` bash
    # stop iptables proccess if running and statr firewalld
    systemctl stop iptables
    systemctl mask iptables
    systemctl unmask firewalld
    systemctl start firewalld

    # listen on port 80 (on server 1)
    vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    systemctl restatrt httpd

    firewall-cmd --list-all
    # http is open but not the 8080 which apache is listening on right now
    firewalld --add-port=8080/tcp

    # Add the Forwarding Rule
    firewall-cmd --add-forward-port=port=8080:proto=tcp:toport=80:toaddr=10.0.1.20

    # permit forwarding
    firewall-cmd --add-masquerade 
    ```

- using iptables

    ``` bash
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.1.20:80
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE

    iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp -d 10.0.1.20 --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
    iptables -I FORWARD -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

    # enable IP forwarding
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

    # open up port 80 on the server 1 in order to accept connections on it
    iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

    # update apche web server to listen on port 80
    vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    systemctl restatrt httpd
    ```

## lab 3

> We need to configure Server1 so that incoming web traffic (port 80) requests from 10.0.1.0/24 are forwarded to Server2 (but not publicly)
>
> Requests from all other sources should remain unforwarded. 
>
> We will need to do this using firewalld

```bash
# verify port 80 is open on both servers from Client1 (10.0.1.11)
curl 10.0.1.10
curl 10.0.1.20

# configure port 8080 on the server 1 to allow traffic on port 8080
firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp

# Create a Zone named `testing` to Handle the Subnet Requests on Server 1
firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=testing
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=testing --add-source=10.0.1.0/24 # Add the subnet as the source
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=testing --add-service=http # Make sure http as a service is added
firewall-cmd --reload # Reload the configuration to pick up these changes

# Enable Masquerading for the Zone
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=testing --add-masquerade # permit forwarding
firewall-cmd --reload

# Add the Forwarding Rule to the Zone
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=testing --add-forward-port=port=80:proto=tcp:toport=80:toaddr=10.0.1.20
firewall-cmd --reload

# Confirm the Port is Forwarded from Client1 but not from your local machine
curl 10.0.1.10:80 # response from server 2
curl 54.144.41.70:80 # response from server 1
```
