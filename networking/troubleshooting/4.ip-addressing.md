# IP addressing

> IP is the address of your machine on the network

- necessary for Layer 3 addressing on the network

- `IPv4` comprises of 4 octets (32 bits)

- `IPv6` comprises of 8 parts of 16 bits (128 bits)

- remove leading zeros from each parts

- the network portion of the IP will be used for routing.

- in `IPv4`, the bits in subnets are named `Network` portion and the remainings are `Host` portion.

- in `IPv6`, the first 4 parts are the `Network` portion and the last 4 parts are the `Node` portion which is generated based on the MAC address of the network interface, also in the `Network` portion the first 3 parts are for `Global` network and the last part is the `internal` or private part of the network.

## IPv4 classes

### class A

- starts with leading 0

- ranges over 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255

- has the 255.0.0.0 subnet -> 16777216 - 2 usable hosts

- private network ranges over 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

- the first octet is the network and th last 3 octets are host portions.

### class B

- starts with leading 10

- ranges over 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255

- has the 255.255.0.0 subnet -> 65536 - 2 usable hosts

- private network ranges over 172.0.0.0 to 172.255.255.255

- the first 2 octets is the network and th last 2 octets are host portions.

### class C

- starts with leading 110

- 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255

- has the 255.255.255.0 subnet -> 256 - 2 usable hosts

- private network ranges over 192.0.0.0 to 192.255.255.255

- the first 3 octets is the network and th last octet are host portions.

### class D

- starts with leading 1110

- 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255

- reserved for multicast

### class E

- starts with leading 1111

- 240.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255

- reserved for experimental use

## CIDR (classless inter domain routing)

> the alternative to class IPs and represented by `/` with following netmask number.
>
> it permits more flexibility in network size over the traditional classless design.

## IPv6 address types

1. `Global unicast`: internet scoped, start with `2001`

2. `Unique local`: internal network scoped, not routed on the internet

3. `Link local`: network linked scoped, starts with `fe80`
