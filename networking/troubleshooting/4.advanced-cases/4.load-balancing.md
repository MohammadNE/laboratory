# Load Balancing

- act as a traffic director to distribute and manage traffic accross the backend nodes

- high availability

- horizontal scaling

- architectural flexibility

## algorithms

- `round robin`: request are distributed sequentially

- `least connections`: new requests are send to the backend nodes with the least current connections

- `source/ip hash`: ip of clients are used to determine the backend destination

## session handling

- `session persistence`: maintaining a session to stick a client to the same backend node

- `hardware`

- `software`

## configuraton

- from clients it should know the protocol(http), algorithm(or mode) and the port listening on

- from the backend side it should know the list of backend hosts
