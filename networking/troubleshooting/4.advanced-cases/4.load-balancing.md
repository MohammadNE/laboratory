# Load Balancing

- act as a traffic director to distribute and manage traffic accross the backend nodes

- high availability

- horizontal scaling

- architectural flexibility

## algorithms

- `round robin`: request are distributed sequentially

- `least connections`: new requests are send to the backend nodes with the least current connections

- `source/ip hash`: ip of clients are used to determine the backend destination

## session handling

- `session persistence`: maintaining a session to stick a client to the same backend node

- `hardware`

- `software`

## configuraton

- from clients it should know the protocol(http), algorithm(or mode) and the port listening on

- from the backend side it should know the list of backend hosts

## NGINX

- can function as a caching `web server` as well as loadbalancer

- limited statistics

- paid solution is more flexible

- on the loadbalancer at 10.0.1.10

    ```cfg
    http {
        upstream demoapp {
            ip_hash;
            server 10.0.1.20:8080;
            server 10.0.1.30:8080;
        }

        server {
            listen 80;

            location / {
                proxy_pass http://demoapp
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y epel-release
    sudo yum install -y nginx

    systemctl enable nginx && systemctl start nginx

    # edit configuration (above configuration)
    vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    systemctl restart nginx

    ss -lntp

    for i in {1..10}; do curl localhost; done
    ```

## HAPROXY

- does not provide web server functionality

- robust metrics

- easy to integrate with a 3rd-party monitoring

> here we have a loadbalancer at 10.0.1.10 and 2 apache web servers at 10.0.1.20 and 10.0.1.30 and a client running at 10.0.1.11

- on node 10.0.1.20 and 10.0.1.30

    ```bash
    # listen apcahe on port 8080
    vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    systemctl restart httpd

    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
    firewall-cmd --reload

    curl localhost:8080
    # got response
    ```

- on the loadbalancer at 10.0.1.10

    ```cfg
    frontend demo_app
        bind *:80
        mode http
        default_backend apache_nodes

    backend apache_nodes
        mode http
        balance roundrobin
        option forwardfor
        server node1 10.0.1.20:8080 check
        server node2 10.0.1.30:8080 check
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y haproxy
    systemctl enable haproxy && systemctl statrt haproxy

    # open up http port on loadbalancer
    firewall-cmd --list-all
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http

    # populate haproxy config with above configuration
    vim /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    systemctl restart haproxy

    for i in {1..10}; do curl localhost; done
    ```
