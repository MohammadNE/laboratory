## squid

> Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages. Squid has extensive access controls and makes a great server accelerator.

> here we have a squid proxy server at 10.0.1.10 and the client at 10.0.1.11 in the VPC and we only allow client to access the linuxacademy.com

- on the proxy server

    - only allow linuxacademy.com

        ```conf
        # INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
        acl whitelist dstdomain .linuxacademy.com
        http_access allow whitelist
        ```
    
    - only block linuxacademy.com

        ```conf
        # INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
        acl blacklist dstdomain .linuxacademy.com
        http_access deny blacklist
        ```

    ```bash
    yum install -y squid
    systemctl enable squid && systemctl start squid

    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=squid
    firewall-cmd --reload

    cat /etc/squid/squid.conf | grep "^[^#]"

    # edit configs based on above configuration
    vim /etc/squid/squid.conf

    systemctl restart squid

    # client access logs
    tail /var/log/squid/access.log
    ```

- on the client

    ```bash
    export http_proxy="http://10.0.1.10:3128"
    curl -I apache.org
    curl -I linuxacademy.com
    ```
    
    - the http_proxy env allows you to connect text based session and/or applications via the proxy server
