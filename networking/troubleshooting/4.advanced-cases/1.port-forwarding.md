# Port Forwarding

## lab 1

> the server 1 hosting httpd on port 8080 and let's redirect traffic on port 80 to the port 8080

- with firewalld

    ``` bash
    # listen on port 8080 (on server 1)
    vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    systemctl restatrt httpd

    # Add the Forwarding Rule
    firewall-cmd --add-forward-port=port=80:proto=tcp:toport=8080
    ```

- with iptables

    ``` bash
    iptables -nL
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

    # accpet external traffic on port 8080
    iptables -L --line-number
    iptables -I  INPUT 4 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
    ```
