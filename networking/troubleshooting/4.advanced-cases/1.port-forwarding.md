# Port Forwarding

> we have 2 servers in the VPC
>
> server 1 is publicly available (NATed) and has 10.0.1.10 private IP with a running web server hosted on port 80
> 
> server 2 is a private one and has 10.0.1.20 as private IP with a running mysql DB on it on port 3306 and with a running web server hosted on port 80
>
> here if we want to ssh to server 2, we have to ssh to server 1 and then ssh into server 2
>
> both servers have ports 22, 80, 8080 open
>
> here we want to implement the architecture somehow that requesting port 8080 of server 1 makes a request to port 80 of server 2 and return back the response

## lab 1

> here we use iptables instead of firewalld
>
> the server 1 hosting httpd on port 8080 and let's redirect traffic on port 80 to the port 8080

- with firewalld

    ``` bash
    # listen on port 8080 (on server 1)
    vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    systemctl restatrt httpd

    # Add the Forwarding Rule
    firewall-cmd --add-forward-port=port=80:proto=tcp:toport=8080
    ```

- with iptables

    ``` bash
    iptables -nL
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

    # accpet external traffic on port 8080
    iptables -L --line-number
    iptables -I  INPUT 4 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
    ```

## lab 2

- using firewalld

``` bash
# stop iptables proccess if running and statr firewalld
systemctl stop iptables
systemctl mask iptables
systemctl unmask firewalld
systemctl start firewalld

# listen on port 80 (on server 1)
vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
systemctl restatrt httpd

firewall-cmd --list-all
# http is open but not the 8080 which apache is listening on right now
firewalld --add-port=8080/tcp

# Add the Forwarding Rule
firewall-cmd --add-forward-port=port=8080:proto=tcp:toport=80:toaddr=10.0.1.20

# permit forwarding
firewall-cmd --add-masquerade 
```

- using iptables

    ``` bash
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.1.20:80
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE

    iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp -d 10.0.1.20 --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
    iptables -I FORWARD -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

    # enable IP forwarding
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

    # open up port 80 on the server 1 in order to accept connections on it
    iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

    # update apche web server to listen on port 80
    vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    systemctl restatrt httpd
    ```
