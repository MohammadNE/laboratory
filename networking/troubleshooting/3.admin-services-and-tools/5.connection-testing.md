# Connection testing

## steps

> this is done throw OSI model as below normally starting from Layer 7

### layer2

- Data Link (MAC), switch and vlan configuration, MAC addressing and IP conflicts

- arping

### layer3

- Network IP, addressing and routing

- ping, traceroute, tracepath

### layer4

- Transport, blocked ports

- ss, telnet, tcpdump, nc, nmap

### layer5-7

- Application

- dig, service tools

## lab 1

> the server has 2 NIC with IPs of 10.0.1.10 and 10.0.1.20 and a running apache web server hosted on 10.0.1.20:80
>
> the client has the address of 10.0.1.11

- on the 10.0.1.11 client

    ``` bash
    curl -I 10.0.1.20
    # there is no response
    ```

- on the server 10.0.1.10 (with ssh)

    ``` bash
    ss -lntp | grep :80
    # the apache web server isn't running

    # start apache web server
    systemctl start httpd

    # verify apache is running
    ss -lntp | grep :80
    ```

- on the 10.0.1.11 client

    ``` bash
    curl -I 10.0.1.20
    # there is no response again
    ```

- on the server 10.0.1.10

    ``` bash
    curl -I 10.0.1.20
    # the server respond correctly

    # verify your current firewall process
    systemctl status {firewalld,iptables}

    firewall-cmd --list-all

    # add http service
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http && firewall-cmd --reload

    # let's check the routing table (layer 3 issue)
    # we guess that we have some asymetric issue on AWS EC2
    # we create 2 routing table
    ip route add 10.0.1.0/24 dev eth0 tab 1
    ip route add 10.0.1.0/24 dev eth1 tab 2
    ip route show tab 1
    ip rule add from 10.0.1.0/24 tab 1
    ip rule add from 10.0.1.0/24 tab 2

    # now the asymetric issue is resolved and the server is accessible
    ```

## lab 2

- on the server

    ``` bash
    # install netcat
    sudo yum install -y nmap-ncat

    # listen on the server to test connectivity with the server (on port 100)
    nc -l 100

    # allow the firewall to bypass tcp connections on port 100
    firewall-cmd --add-port=100/tcp
    ```

- on the client 10.0.1.11

    ``` bash
    # telnet is very useful for testing connection
    telnet 10.0.1.10 100
    ```


## lab 3

- on the server

    ``` bash
    # install tcpdump
    sudo yum install -y tcpdump

    # capture connections to the port 100
    tcpdump port 100

    # or filter it based on the source IP
    tcpdump -n -i eth1 src host 10.0.1.11
    ```

- on the client 10.0.1.11

    ``` bash
    # telnet is very useful for testing connection
    telnet 10.0.1.10 100
    # connection is refused because nothing is listening on that port

    # response from httpd deamon
    curl -I 10.0.1.20
    ```
