# Machine Interface

- `loopback inteface` : special virtual interface host uses to communicate to itself.

## concepts

### MAC address

> unique fingerprint of the network interface

### IP address

> unique address on the network assigned by DHCP.

### Subnet or Netmask

> seperates the IP into network and host adresses.

### Gateway

> the connection leading outside of the lcoal network
>
> we use the gateway to connect anything outside the LAN.

### DNS host

> translates hostnames into IP addresses

### DNS domain

> the lookup domain for the host

## commands

### ip address show

> to get IP address of your machine

### systemctl status NetworkManager

> check weather nmcli is usable or not

### nmcli

> network manager cli

### nmcli c show

> show active internet connections.

### nmcli d show eth0

> here there is information about `IP address`, `netmask`, `gateway`, `dns server`, `dns domain` and etc.
>
> the device can be adhered from looking the connections (above cmd)

### ip route show

### routel

> list routing table

- the information about DHCP server and Netmask can be found on your router page setting.
