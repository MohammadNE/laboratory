# Packet Flow

1. DNS, if a domain is being used a DNS query will be sent to determine destination IP address.

2. TCP, to initiate connection (connection data will be passed back and forth between source and destination)

3. ARP, to find out the actual MAC address (layer 2)

- use `wireshark` and `tcpdump` to capture the traffic and its packet flow
