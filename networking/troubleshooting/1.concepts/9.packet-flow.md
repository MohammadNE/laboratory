# Packet Flow

1. DNS, if a domain is being used a DNS query will be sent to determine destination IP address.

2. ARP, to find out the actual MAC address

3. TCP, to initiate connection (connection data will be passed back and forth between source and destination)

- use `wireshark` and `tcpdump` to capture the traffic and its packet flow
