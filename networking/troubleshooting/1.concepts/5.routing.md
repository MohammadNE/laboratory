# Routing

- `router` is a layer 3 device and functions at IP level.

- a router forwards packet data between networks.

- routing information is contained in a routing table

- the routing table is a static table mapping of the best path to a network destination.

- the routing table lists destinations and gateways for the networks the host belongs to.

- if the destination is outside of the local network, use the gateway but if it's local then don't use the gateway.

- static routes can be used for connections that can't (or shouldn't) use the default gateway.

- example: the 172.31.96.0/20 is the server network and the office network is 10.0.0.0/8, the office network is accessible via a router with the IP of the 172.31.96.2 on the server network then a route would need to be added to permit this host to communicate with the office network using that router.

## BGP (Border Gateway protocol)

> routing protocol used to route traffic across the internet, it's how the internet works

- it's a layer 4 protocol on top of TCP
