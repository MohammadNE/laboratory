# DNS (Domain Name Service)

> the service used for discovering the IP associated with a given domain name

- DNS is a layer 7 protocol

## FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)

> the complete domain name for a specific host on the network like www.example.com

- the computer will send a query to DNS server asking it to resolve a FQDN to an IP address and then looks at the routing table to determine where to send the request.
