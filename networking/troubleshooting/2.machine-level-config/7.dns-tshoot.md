# DNS Troubleshooting

- let's curl some websites

``` bash
curl -I linuxacademy.com
# curl: (6) Could not resolve host: linuxacademy.com; Unknown error

curl -I example.com
# curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com; Unknown error
```

- seems there is a DNS issue

``` bash
cat /etc/nsswitch.conf | grep hosts
# files dns myhostnames

cat /etc/hosts
# the file contains '172.31.100.41 example.com'

# we grasp the issue with example.com, let's fix it
sed -i '/172.31.100.41/d' /etc/hosts
```

- here we have fixed the `example.com` issue, let's resolve the `linuxacademy.com`

``` bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
# search mylabserver.com
# nameserver 172.31.0.1

dig linuxacademy.com
# no servers could be reached

# so there's an issue with DNS server

telnet 172.31.0.1 53
# timeout

# so DNS server is non functional

ip route s
```

- let's determine whether we could use public DNS

``` bash
ping 1.1.1.1
dig @1.1.1.1 linuxacademy.com
```

- so it's definetly our DNS server problem

``` bash
nmcli con mod System\ eth0 ipv4.dns 10.0.0.1
systemctl restart network
cat /etc/resolv.conf
dig linuxacademy.com
```
