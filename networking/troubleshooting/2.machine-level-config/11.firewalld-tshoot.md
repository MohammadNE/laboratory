# Firewalld troubleshooting

here we have 2 clients (10.0.1.11 and 10.0.1.12) and a server (10.0.1.10) with sshd and httpd and some firewall rules.

- on the server with `iptables`

    ``` bash
    # see what services are running on which ports on localhost
    ss -lntp

    curl -I localhost
    # the httpd service acting normally

    # see list of port and IP numbers with verbosity
    iptables -vnL
    # we can see the order has some problems

    # change the order of the policies
    vim /etv/sysconfig/iptables
    systemctl restart iptables
    ```

- on the server with `firewalld` (the rich-rule order is matter)

    ``` bash
    firewall-cmd --list-all

    # reject all traffic from 10.0.1.10/24
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=10.0.1.10/24 port port=80 protocol=tcp reject'
    firewall-cmd --reload

    # allow traffic from 10.0.1.11
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=10.0.1.11 port port=80 protocol=tcp accept'
    firewall-cmd --reload

    firewall-cmd --list-all
    ```

- on client 1 (10.0.1.11)

    ``` bash
    curl -I 10.0.1.10
    # no route to host
    # back to the server and check its iptables

    curl -I 10.0.1.10
    # OK :))
    ```
