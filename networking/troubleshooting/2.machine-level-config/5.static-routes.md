# Static Routes

> A static route is nothing but a way of specifying traffic that must not go through the default gateway

- read [here](https://devconnected.com/how-to-add-route-on-linux) for more information

- static routes are added for a specific interface

``` bash
# get your current routes
route -n # deprecated
ip route
# default 10.0.0.1/24 | eth0 | src 10.0.1.10


# prohibit a host to access cloudflare
ip route add prohibit 1.1.1.1
ping 1.1.1.1
curl -I 1.1.1.1

# access to a prohibited IP
ip route flush 1.1.1.1

# send traffic of the cloudFlare from eth0
ip route add 1.1.1.1 via 10.0.1.10 dev eth0
ip route flush 1.1.1.1

# the 10.0.1.1 is the default gateway and we say to send the traffic throw this gateway
ip route add 1.1.1.1 via 10.0.1.1 dev eth1

# ping 1.1.1.1 throw specified NIC
ping -I etho 1.1.1.1

# add 10.0.8.0/24 subnet with 10.0.1.20 gateway
ip route add 10.0.8.0/24 via 10.0.1.20
```
