# Static IP and DHCP

## static IP

- dedicated, unchanged IP addresses assigned to the device

- upon setting it, you must also specify the subnet, gateway and DNS host info

- used for important network devices and hosts that require absolute connectivity

### requirements

- IP address

- netmask

- gateway IP

- DNS host (optional)

- DNS domain (optional)

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- dynamic address assigned from a pool of IP addresses within the DHCP scope.

- DHCP will normally provide subnet, gateway and DNS info upon assigning IP address.

- typically used for host requiring transient connections or managing the IP addresses of a large number of hosts.

- DHCP server uses UDP port 67 and clients uses UDP port 68.

- DHCP request and offer are layer 2 broadcasts (like ARP requests) and requires a running DHCP client.

- `DHCP lease` is a temporary assignment of an IP address to a device on the network.

### DHCP sequence

1. `DHCP discover`, the client broadcast a request looking for a host that can assign it an IP address

2. `DHCP offer`, DHCP server respond and offer an IP address

3. `DHCP request`, the client will request the offered address

4. `DHCP acknowledge`, the DHCP server will acknowledge that the IP address has been assigned

## commands

### cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases

> view lease information on the host

### sudo grep "DHCPOFFER" /var/log/messages

> lookup DHCP host

### ss -luntp | grep dhclient

> show processes listening on udp or tcp without resolving service names
