# Firewall

> set rules on the network traffic (input/output)

## netfilter

> a framework provided by the linux kernel

> a registered callback function is then called back for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the network stack.

- it allows: `packet filtering`, `NAT`, `port translation`

## services for implementation

- `system-config-firewall` is GUI frontend that interact with `iptables.service`

- `iptables.service` is a service for `/sbin/iptables` command

- `/sbin/iptables` interact with the hooks provided by `netfilter`

- the `D-Bus`, `firewall-config` and `firewall-cmd` all interact with `firewalld.service`

- `firewalld.service` uses `/sbin/iptables` for its configuration

## work around

- on the server (10.0.1.10)

    ``` bash
    # there's apache server running on port 80
    ss -lntp | grep :80

    curl localhost

    # prohibit traffic administratively
    systemctl start iptables

    # it's ok but the client will be prohibited
    curl localhost

    tcpdump -i eth0 port 80

    # allow client to request
    systemctl stop iptables
    tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
    ```

- on the client (10.0.1.11)

    ``` bash
    curl 10.0.1.10
    ```
