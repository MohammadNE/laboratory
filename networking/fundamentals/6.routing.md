# Routing

> moving data from one network to another.

- `routers` forward data between networks and decide which path to use like when you visiting a web page.

- between the source and destination usually sits lot of routers that routes the packets.

## Routing Tables

> routers store information about other networks in routing tables.
>
> they get this information from other routers.

## Routing protocols

> routers have their own rules for communication.
>
> these rules are known as routing protocols, this is how they share information about other networks.

## static routes

> the router always use the same path to send data between networks

## dynamic routers

> the router change its path of the data packets based on various factors like network congestion, router outages, speed and etc.
