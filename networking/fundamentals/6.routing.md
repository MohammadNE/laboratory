# Routing

> moving data from one network to another.

- `routers` forward data between networks and decide which path to use like when you visiting a web page.

- between the source and destination usually sits lot of routers that routes the packets.

- Your private IP is distributed by your local router so it is unique to your device on your LAN so another device on another home network might use the same IP address but you won't know because you can't contact another device using their Private IP on a different network.

- the `loopback` doesn't use the NIC and instead uses `virtual network interface` from the OS.

## Routing Tables

> routers store information about other networks in routing tables.
>
> they get this information from other routers.

## Routing protocols

> routers have their own rules for communication.
>
> these rules are known as routing protocols, this is how they share information about other networks.

- Routers use their own language referred to as routing protocols to tell each other about different routes on a network.

## static routes

> the router always use the same path to send data between networks

## dynamic routers

> the router change its path of the data packets based on various factors like network congestion, router outages, speed and etc.

## setting a static host entry (alias) in linux

``` bash
ip address show

# add 10.0.1.101 entry to the web
vim /etc/hosts

ping web
curl web
ssh web
```
