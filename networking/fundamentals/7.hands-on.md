# Hands On

## ip information

- `ip address show` or `ip a s` : the modern cmd which contains MAC address

- `ifconfig` : achronym for interface config and is now the legacy way

## routes

- `ip route` : shows the packets leaves the computer with which IP address

- `route` : the legacy way of the ip

- `netstat -rn` : another way

## DNS (resolver config)

- `nmcli` : network manager to change and view the resolvers, it gives us the interface name, the IP addresses and the routes and also it gives us the DNS configuration

- view the contents of `/etc/resolv.conf` which is generated with network Manager

## finding remote network information (host IP address and the nameserver resolver address)

- `dig google.com` : lookup remote host information of the google.co

- `host google.com` and `nslookup google.com` are the legacy commands

## routing

- `traceroute google.com` : show the actual route taken by the packets to rach the remote host

## availabilty

- `ping` uses ICMP protocol to check if remote system is online and responding
