## what is an image
- app binaries and dependencies of an app
- it's metadata about the image and how to run the image
- ordered collection of root filesystem changes and corresponding execution parameters (official)
- not a complete OS, No kernel or kernel modules (driver)
- from size it can be small like go static binary or big as ubuntu with apt and ... on it.

in docker hub, 
each version can have multiple tags and tags are the same

some applications like go can have base image of debian or alpine,
they are different

all images will be start from base image named `scratch`, after that
any changes in filesystem in the image is another layer

## visulizing layers
https://jessicagreben.medium.com/digging-into-docker-layers-c22f948ed612

## IMAGE LAYERS (show layers of changes made in image or history of an image layers)
- docker image history nginx:latest

### notes
- images are made-up of file-system changes and metadata
- each layer is uniquely identified and only stored once on a host
- a container is just a single read-write layer on top of image

## Display detailed information on one or more images (json metadata)
- docker image inspect

## image tagging
tags are labels that points to a specific image commit
when you run ls command on image, it will list image repository
repository is combo of: repository_name/organization_name

### note
- default tag is latest if not specified
- offical repositories live at `root namespace` of registry and they don't
need account name in front of repo name.
tag: pointer to (lable for) a specific image commit and really could be anything into repo.

## Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE
- docker image tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
- docker image tag nginx:latest mohammadne3311/nginx:testing_tag

## upload and push an image
- docker login
- docker image push TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]

## building images (dockerfile basics)
- dockerfiles are recipe for creating images
- dockerhub images were created from dockerfiles
- it's like a shell script but it's NOT.
- package managers are one of the reasons to 
build containers from linux distros.

## most important dockerfile commands
1. FROM
all images must have a FROM
- https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004012857-What-are-docker-scratch-based-images-

2. ENV
a way to set env, main way to set keys and values for container
building and for running containers, inject key/value pairs on every OS and config.

3. RUN
executing shell commands

4. EXPOSE
by default no TCP or UDP ports are open inside a container

5. CMD
require and final paramerter which run when container is launched

## build an image
- https://thenewstack.io/docker-basics-how-to-use-dockerfiles/
- docker image build -t new-name .
- (custom-file) docker image build -t nginx-with-html -f 3.Dockerfile .
- (default Dockerfile) docker image build -t nginx-with-html .

### notes
- it will build only from dockerfile
- you can do stuffs at build time

- keep `change-less` at the top
- keep `change-more` at the bottom
=> to keep time and space
