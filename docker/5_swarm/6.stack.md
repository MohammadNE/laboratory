## Stacks: 

> production grade compose

- stacks are layer of abstraction to swarm

- it's about stacks of services, manages services in a compose.
with it you can properly deploy them.

- it accept compose file as their declarative definition for services, 
networks and volumes

- to import compose files we run: `docker stack deploy`

- stack manage overlay network per stack and adds stack name to
start of their name.

- new `deploy:` ket in compose file, can't do `build:`

### deploy with stack

- `docker stack deploy -c 7.stack-compose.yml voteapp`: run (also update) custom compose

- `docker stack deploy voteapp`: run (also update) default compose (name and path)

- `docker stack services voteapp`: list services

- `docker stack ps voteapp`: list tasks on which node

### notes

- `docker-compose` ignores `deploy:` in compose file

- `docker swarm` ignores `build:` in compose file

- `docker-compose` is a development and sysadmin tool so it doesn't
ship with default docker production so it's cli not needed on swarm server
