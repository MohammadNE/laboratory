# Networking

- [Docker Bridge Network](https://medium.com/@augustineozor/understanding-docker-bridge-network-6e499da50f65)

- create a docker network bridge and connect exsisting containers (which are already connected to kind network) to another network (2 network)

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge --opt com.docker.network.container_iface_prefix=public \
--opt com.docker.network.bridge.name=public-bridge \
--opt com.docker.network.driver.mtu=9000 \
--subnet 172.31.10.0/24 public-bridge

# see created bridge in the IPs
# the default bridge device name is `docker0` by default
# the host network connects the containers dirrectly to the host-network-interface
ip address list

export K8S_NODES=$($KIND get nodes --name devenv)
parallel docker network connect public-bridge {} ::: $K8S_NODES

# see networks that a container is connected to
docker inspect devenv-worker -f "{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks }}"
```
