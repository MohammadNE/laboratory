## the problem
- Containers are usually immutable and ephemeral
- "immutable infrastructure": only re-deploy containers, never change
- Docker gives us features to ensure these "separation of concerns", 
this is known as "persistent data" in two ways: Volumes and Bind Mounts
- Volumes: make special location outside of container UFS(union file system)
- Bind Mounts: link container path to host path directory

## DATA VOLUMES
- docker container run -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=True -v /var/lib/mysql mysql

### notes
- will create a new volume-location in container
- by saying `VOLUME`, we means that the data is more important than container
- the data will be stored also at the host
- by deletion of containers, the data will be present at the host

## NAMED VOLUMES
- docker container run -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=True -v mysql-db:/var/lib/mysql mysql
option: `-v`

### notes
- named-volumes are friendly way to assign vols to containers
- if you have a common database and ..., it's a good option to use

## BIND MOUNTING
- (new) docker container run -d --name new_nginx -p 80:80 --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
- (old) docker container run -d --name new_nginx -p 80:80 -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html nginx


### notes
- in the above command, we mount `pwd` to target after `:` of nginx 
- it will maps a host-file or directory to a container-file or directory
- basically just 2 locations pointing to the same file(s)
- again, skips UFS and the data will be at host by deletion of container
- can't use in Dockerfile, must be at `container run`
